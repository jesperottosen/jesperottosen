# A communications Readme ðŸ‘‹
Everyone is different and has different things that make them tick different things that annoy them, and different preferences for communication. I want to give anyone who needs to know, an insight into how I work best and how to get the best out of me when you need me to do something. 

I run on Intuition and Reflection. I prefer Collaboration and Coalition (https://qualityeng.substack.com/p/scales-of-collaboration?utm_source=profile&utm_medium=reader2) over command and Control. 

# How I work
- I run Inbox 0, and things generally get answered as quickly as I can - when I have the information requested. Then the mail is put in a topic folder.
- My day is on my calendar, but I seldom double-book timeslots. I prioritize.
- Recurring housekeeping and topics to remember get added to my Outlook task list.
  
# How to reach me
- If it's quick and something that can wait send me a chat, but write the topic first of the bat.
- If we need to chat on the topic, book me in my calendar, it's open.

# Quirks
- I have a blind spot in creating Minutes of Meetings of my many meetings. Especially if I'm the meeting facilitator, which I often am. Pr. default I assume that people take note of their action items. It helps to have a virtual board to track progress.
- Absence of formality in work items is often on purpose. I try to achieve the least amount of formality needed, and would rather do with less. The easiest thing is to add more formality, that just doesn't give a healthy relationship.
- "Dear" is a reserved word for a few people only, hence my emails start with "Hi <name>"
- My email content might be a bit brief and to the point. 
  
# Icebreakers
- Talk to me about my LeanPub books: "**Goal-Aligned Test Strategies**", "**Leading Testing Activities**", and "**Staff Level Testing Roles**".
- My most recent LEGO build
- My most recent garden battles, the war on the Bambus for instance.
