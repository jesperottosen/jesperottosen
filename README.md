# A communications Readme ðŸ‘‹
Everyone is different and has different things that make them tick different things that annoy them, and different communication preferences. I want to give anyone who needs to know, an insight into how I work best and how to get the best out of me when you need me to do something. 

## About me
- I run on **Intuition and Reflection**. I prefer [Collaboration and Coalition](https://qualityeng.substack.com/p/scales-of-collaboration?) over Command and Control.
- My drive is for **completion** (not perfection) to the extent of the situation.
- I often pause to think, sometimes it's a _latency_ issue. I hate being bulldozed.
- I generally trust people but have also been "burnt" enough to have scars with regards to trust.

## What people say about me
- "Elevate the voices of those around you"
- "Allow everyone to show initiative and be their best self"
  
## How to reach me
- rule number 1: If you ask, I will always find time for you - even if it's unrelated to my current projects.
- I run Inbox 0, and things generally get answered as quickly as possible - when I have the requested information. Then the mail is put in a dedicated topic folder.
- My day is on my calendar, but I seldom double-book timeslots. I prioritize usually, first come - first serve. 
- Recurring housekeeping and topics to remember get added to my Outlook task list.
- If we're in the same location, find me live. If I have a headset, I might just listen to music. Signal me if I'm available.
- If it's quick and something that can wait send me a chat, could you write the topic first of the bat?
- If we need to chat on the topic, book me in my calendar - feel free to find a slot.

## Quirks
- I have a blind spot in creating Minutes of Meetings of my many meetings. Especially if I'm the meeting facilitator, which I often am. Pr. default I assume that people take note of their action items. It helps to have a virtual board to track progress.
- Absence of formality in work items is often on purpose. I try to achieve the least amount of formality needed, and would rather do with less. The easiest thing is to add more formality, that doesn't give a healthy relationship.
- "Dear" is a reserved word for a few people only; my emails start with "Hi <name>"
- My email content might be a bit brief and to the point. 

I wear a "hidden disability" sunflower key hanger on my jacket, sometimes my autism pops up. Usually, it's not that visible - but it has been there [all along](https://jlottosen.wordpress.com/2023/04/04/we-have-been-here-all-along/). 

## Icebreakers
- Talk to me about my LeanPub books: "**Goal-Aligned Test Strategies**", "**Leading Testing Activities**", and "**Staff Level Testing Roles**".
- My most recent LEGO build or purchase
- My most recent garden battles, the war on the Bambus for instance.
