# A communications Readme ðŸ‘‹
The purpose of this document is to summarize some of the values and principles I try to adhere to.
Everyone is different and has different things that make them tick, things that annoy them, and different communication preferences. I want to give anyone who needs to know an insight into how I work best and how to get the most out of me when you need me to do something. 

## About me
- I run on **Intuition and Reflection**. I prefer [Collaboration and Coalition](https://qualityeng.substack.com/p/scales-of-collaboration?) over Command and Control.
- My drive is for **completion** (not perfection) to the extent of the situation.
- I often pause to think; sometimes, it's a _latency_ issue. I hate being bulldozed; give me time. ðŸŒ»
- Give me space to find myself when there are many new things or too many unknowns in a physical setting ðŸŒ»
- I often spot and seek to learn about **higher-level patterns** and trends in projects and organizations 
- I prefer growing ideas, solutions, and people over maintaining and tinkering.
- I thrive with "**how do we solve this**" challenges, using creative thinking and imagination.
- I can be both an extrovert and an introvert, and my strongest side is thinking and reflecting.
- I am drained if too many things happen at once ðŸŒ»
- I generally trust people but have also been "burnt" enough to have scars.
  
## What people say about me
- "Elevate the voices of those around you"
- "Allow everyone to show initiative and be their best self."
  
## How to reach me
- rule number 1: If you ask, I will always find time for you - even if it's unrelated to my current projects. do ask :)
- I run Inbox 0, and things generally get answered as quickly as possible - when I have the requested information. Then, the mail is put in a dedicated topic folder.
My day is on my calendar, but I seldom double-book timeslots. I usually prioritize on a first-come-first-served basis. 
- Recurring housekeeping and topics to remember get added to my Outlook task list.
- If we're in the same location, find me live. If I have a headset, I might just listen to music. Signal me if I'm available.
If it's quick and something that can wait, send me a chat. Could you write the topic first?
If we need to chat about the topic, book me in my calendarâ€”feel free to find a time slot.
- Don't book into my lunch break, though. I need food to balance my metabolism

## Quirks
- I have a blind spot in creating minutes for my many meetings, especially if I'm the meeting facilitator, which I often am. By default, I assume that people take note of their action items. It helps to have a virtual board to track progress.
- The absence of formality in work items is often on purpose. I try to achieve the least amount of formality needed, and I would rather do it with less. More formality is the easiest thing to add but is usually counterproductive to healthy collaboration and effective working methods.
- While I'm in Copenhagen about once a month, I rarely take public transportation when in new places. Too many impressions make it hard for me to acquire consistency. I would rather take a taxi. ðŸŒ»
- Too many people talking at the same time in the same space drains me (audio sensitivity) ðŸŒ»
- "Dear" is a reserved word for a few people only; my emails start with "Hi <name>" 
- My email content might be a bit brief and to the point. ðŸŒ»
- When I'm worn out or under pressure, I can have trouble maintaining eye contact. It's not on purpose ðŸŒ»
- While I do the evening cooking at home, I prefer "meal services" where everything is provided and a step-by-step recipe is available. My household can save money, hassle, and food waste on these, as far as we can tell. ðŸŒ»
- When things get really bad, I probably have issues [displaying the expected emotions](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/what-say-when-you-dont-know-wesley-faulkner-7qc4e/?) ðŸŒ»

ðŸŒ»: I wear a "hidden disability" sunflower key hanger on my jacket, and sometimes my autism pops up. Usually, it's not that visible - but it has been there [all along](https://jlottosen.wordpress.com/2023/04/04/we-have-been-here-all-along/). 

## Icebreakers
- Talk to me about my LeanPub books: "**Goal-Aligned Test Strategies**", "**Leading Testing Activities**", and "**Staff Level Testing Roles**".
- My most recent LEGO build or purchase
- My most recent garden battles, the war on the Bambus for instance.
